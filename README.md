Sonos Web is a browser based controller for your [Sonos](https://www.sonos.com/system) sound system.

Install Sonos Web on a single computer and access and manage your system from any browser on your network.

Sonos Web relies upon the [node-sonos](https://github.com/bencevans/node-sonos) project for all its Sonos communication.

Sonos Web has been tested on Windows 10, macOS, Linux, and Raspbian Stretch Lite (9.6).

[Check out the following Youtube video](https://youtu.be/0q8Z-XV81Z4) to see a brief demo of the system in use. (v0.5.2)

## Oh Fork it's a Fork!

This is a fork of [Villarrealized's excellent project](https://github.com/Villarrealized/sonos-web), which appears to be abandoned.
Despite only being a couple years old, the project has rotted quite quickly and developed many breaking issues.
Several fixes were pulled into a branch by [stufisher](https://github.com/stufisher/sonos-web/tree/update_and_fix) which this fork uses.

When I attempted to get this project working for myself I found that:
* Docker images on Dockerhub that use sonos-web are based off the original project, and thus are broken.
* The installation method [sonos-web-cli](https://github.com/Villarrealized/sonos-web-cli) is of course tied to the original project and is abit infuriating to dissect what its doing
* It's non-obvious how to actually run the project from sources (at least for a node newbie?)
* Even when I got it running with fixes, I still needed to fix an error from [node-sonos](https://github.com/bencevans/node-sonos) to get things running.

So I have added a Makefile that builds and runs a server right from these sources, no sonos-web-cli necessary. Just do `make serve`.
Right now this project depends on a fork of node-sonos, but I submitted a pull request to get the fixes upstream.

I have also added a [Docker image to Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/kcghst/sonos-web) to make the project very convenient for Linux Docker users.

## Build and run from sources

```
make serve
```

## Docker Support

A minimal pre-built Docker image is available on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/kcghst/sonos-web).
Only Linux is currently supported, as you need [Docker's host networking feature](https://docs.docker.com/network/host/) for Sonos device discovery.

The following command starts up the web server listening on port 5050:
```
docker run -it --net=host kcghst/sonos-web

## TODO?

* It might be possible to avoid host networking by allowing manual pre-configuration of Sonos hosts
* Should probably make the web server port configurable
* The Music Library doesn't work for me personally, I think it requires the Windows share?
* Would be nice if it could browse music from a DLNA server, even nicer if it had access to everything the Sonos app does
